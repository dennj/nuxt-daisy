            <p class="text-gray-700">
              A SAFE agreement provides you with the opportunity to invest in a company now and receive equity in the future, typically when the company raises a priced funding round. SAFE agreements are straightforward, fast, and investor-friendly.

            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Convertible loan notes are a hybrid of debt and equity. You provide a loan to the company, which converts into equity upon certain conditions, such as a future funding round or exit event. This structure offers downside protection while still providing equity upside.
